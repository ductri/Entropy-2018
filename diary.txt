- Download dataset
- Reading final round's description
- Considering IDE: juputer notebook or pycharm --> pycharm, because suggestion is the best way for coding fast.
- Data descriptions: 
+ 3 files, negative, neutral and positive. Each csv file contains 1 column. Each row is a sentence, especially, sentences may be in accented or not. 
+ Each row is just a sentence: need to confirm, that mean, it contains almost 1 dot. And thus, the input will not be too long. Anw, we need a statistic here: sentence long.
+ About accent: A simple idea is remove all accents. More complicated one is predict accents and fill out them to non-accented sentences.
+ According to the problem description in pdf file, there are approximately 150k sentences for all classes, 44.1 MB in size, not so much
+ In addition, organizer also provides list of stop words in vietnamese. 
- Merge 3 files into one
- Export some statistics to have some intuition at data.

- TODO: remove too long mention, maybe 1000 as threshold
- Lengh of negative is the longest one, and twice longer than neutral ?
- Data training is quite balance between 3 labels
- TODO: do preprocesses
- TODO: split data to do validation
